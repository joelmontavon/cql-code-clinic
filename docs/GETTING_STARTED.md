## Your First Exercise

Let's try a simple exercise to get you started:

### Exercise: Patient Age Calculator

**Goal:** Calculate a patient's age from their birth date.

**Instructions:**
1. Open the exercise "Basic Date Calculations"
2. Define a patient's birth date
3. Calculate their current age in years
4. Determine if they're a pediatric patient (< 18 years)

**Starter Code:**
```cql
library AgeCalculator

define "PatientBirthDate": @1985-03-15
define "Today": Today()

// Calculate age in years
define "PatientAge": years between PatientBirthDate and Today

// Is this a pediatric patient?
define "IsPediatric": PatientAge < 18
```

**Expected Result:**
- PatientAge: ~38 years (depending on current date)
- IsPediatric: false

**What You'll Learn:**
- CQL library structure
- Date literals and functions
- Age calculations
- Boolean expressions
